        <p>Largely due to the use of neoprene in all of their current pieces, as this fabric is amazingly comfortable and looks great as well. Itâ€™s an exciting fabric to work with as it allows bikinis to hold their shape and look really structured and modern. They also design swimwear that can be worn all day long at the beach; to swim in, sunbake in, run around, etc. Practical and fashionable!</p>
